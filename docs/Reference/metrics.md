**Metrics in ZIO HTTP**

Metrics play a crucial role in monitoring and understanding the performance and behavior of your HTTP applications. ZIO HTTP provides support for integrating metrics into your applications, allowing you to collect and analyze various metrics related to request processing, response times, error rates, and more. Here's an overview of how you can incorporate metrics into your ZIO HTTP applications.

**1. Metric Types**

ZIO HTTP supports different types of metrics that you can track in your applications:

- **Counter**: A counter is a simple metric that keeps track of the number of occurrences of a particular event. For example, you can use a counter to count the number of incoming requests or the number of successful responses.

- **Timer**: A timer measures the duration of a specific operation or process. You can use timers to measure the processing time of requests or specific parts of your application logic.

- **Gauge**: A gauge provides a way to track a specific value or metric at a particular point in time. It can be used to monitor things like the number of active connections or the current memory usage of your application.

- **Histogram**: A histogram captures the statistical distribution of values over a period of time. It can be useful for tracking response times or request sizes.

**2. Metrics Collection**

ZIO HTTP integrates with popular metrics libraries, such as Micrometer, which provides a unified way to collect and export metrics to various monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Graphite, etc.). To collect metrics in your ZIO HTTP application, you can create a `Metrics` object and instrument your routes or middleware with the desired metrics.

Here's an example of using Micrometer with ZIO HTTP to collect request count and response time metrics:

```scala
import zio.http._
import zio.metrics._
import zio._
import zio.clock.Clock

val httpApp: HttpApp[Clock with Metrics, Throwable] = Http.collectM {
  case Method.GET -> Root / "api" / "endpoint" =>
    for {
      startTime <- clock.nanoTime
      _ <- metrics.incrementCounter("requests")
      response <- ZIO.succeed(Response.text("Hello, World!"))
      endTime <- clock.nanoTime
      elapsedTime = (endTime - startTime) / 1000000 // Calculate elapsed time in milliseconds
      _ <- metrics.recordTimer("responseTime", elapsedTime)
    } yield response
}
```

In this example, we create a `Metrics` object by mixing the `Clock` and `Metrics` capabilities into the environment. Within the HTTP route, we increment the "requests" counter to track the number of incoming requests and record the elapsed time in the "responseTime" timer to measure the response processing time.

**3. Exporting Metrics**

Once you have collected the metrics, you can export them to your preferred monitoring system. Micrometer provides integrations with various monitoring systems, allowing you to configure the export of metrics.

For example, to export the metrics to Prometheus, you can include the Prometheus Micrometer library in your project and configure it to scrape the metrics:

```scala
import io.micrometer.prometheus.PrometheusMeterRegistry

val registry = new PrometheusMeterRegistry()
Metrics.export(registry)
```

In this example, we create a `PrometheusMeterRegistry` and configure the `Metrics` object to export the collected metrics to this registry. You can then expose an endpoint in your application to expose the Prometheus metrics endpoint, which can be scraped by Prometheus for monitoring and visualization.

**Summary**

By integrating metrics into your ZIO HTTP applications, you can gain insights into the performance, behavior, and health of your HTTP services. ZIO HTTP provides support for different metric types, allowing you to track request counts, response times, and more. Integration with libraries like Micrometer enables

 you to export metrics to various monitoring systems for analysis and visualization.
