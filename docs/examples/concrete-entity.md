`Concrete entities` refer to specific data models or classes that represent the request and response payloads in an HTTP application. 

This code is an example demonstrating how to build an application using concrete entities in ZIO HTTP:

```scala mdoc:passthrough
import utils._

printSource("zio-http-example/src/main/scala/example/endpoint/CliExamples.scala")
```
